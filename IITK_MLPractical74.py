#Binarize Data (Make Binary)

[ 2., 0., 0.],

#You can transform your data using a binary threshold.

# All values above the threshold are marked 1 and
# all equal to or below are marked as 0.

# This is called binarizing your data or  thresholding your data.

# It can be useful when you have probabilities that you want to make crisp values.

# It is also useful when feature engineering and you want to add new features that indicate something meaningful.
